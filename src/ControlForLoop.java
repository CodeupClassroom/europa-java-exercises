         *
         * I always used to use i++ in for-loops until looking through the asm output of a 68k C compiler,
         * I noticed that it included an extra move instruction, to save the current state of i before incrementing it!
         *
         * A quick check of gcc on the x86 showed that the compiler optimised the move away as it was able to
         * recognise the original state of i was never used, but the 68k compiler did not optimise thisâ€¦ so I got
         * into the good practice of putting the increment/decrement operator in the correct place.
